# First Mini Project : “Make it”  
## Subject  
This is my very first front-end / back-end project.
The goal of this project was to apply both back-end and front-end knowledge learned in class in order to create a client management system.
My project was a little different as I decided to build a to-do list system that I called “Make it”.
Based on the CRUD model, users can create an account or login and retrieve, modify or delete information from their personal projects or tasks.
