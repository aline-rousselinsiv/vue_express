# First Mini Project : “Make it”  
## Subject  
This is my very first front-end / back-end project.
The goal of this project was to apply both back-end and front-end knowledge learned in class in order to create a client management system.
My project was a little different as I decided to build a to-do list system that I called “Make it”.
Based on the CRUD model, users can create an account or login and retrieve, modify or delete information from their personal projects or tasks.

## After Project
*Things I would improve/wish to continue working on:*
**Back-End**
+ Edit part : it allows the user to change information both related to the project or the tasks, but does not offer the possibility to delete tasks yet.
+ Add tasks function : users should be able to add as many tasks as they want but I limited the number of tasks per project to 5 as a test-run. I think I could change that function and modify my frond-end code accordingly.
+ Others : I considered adding other functions such as a calendar that would display the user’s projects over time.
**Front-End**
+ I decided to keep the front-end part rather simple and neutral in order to focus on implementing all the different operations learned in class, but I would like to work on a more responsive design such as smoother transitions or swiper functions instead of a “plain” display. I failed on implementing the library Swup as I encountered issues such as “jumpy” effects when transitioning.
